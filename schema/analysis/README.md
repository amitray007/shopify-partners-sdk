# Schema Analysis Results

This directory contains generated analysis files from the GraphQL schema analysis utilities in `../utils/`.

## Files

### Core Analysis

- **`complete_field_structures.txt`** - Comprehensive documentation of all GraphQL types, queries, and mutations with complete field structures and interface implementations
- **`detailed_query_examples.md`** - Markdown documentation with complete GraphQL query and mutation examples, including proper interface fragments and realistic variables

### Version Analysis

- **`version_comparison.md`** - Detailed comparison between schema versions showing added/removed types, queries, mutations, and modified fields
- **`evolution_summary.txt`** - Brief summary of schema evolution across all versions
- **`schema_summary.txt`** - Statistical summary of each schema version (type counts, query/mutation counts)

## File Descriptions

### complete_field_structures.txt

Contains detailed analysis of:
- All 9 queries with complete argument and return type information
- All 3 mutations with input/output specifications
- Interface implementations (Transaction → AppOneTimeSale, etc.)
- Connection patterns for pagination
- Enum types and their values
- Version differences highlighting new features

### detailed_query_examples.md

Provides ready-to-use GraphQL examples:
- Complete query structures with all available fields
- Proper interface fragments showing polymorphic usage
- Realistic variable examples with proper GID formats
- Connection queries with pagination arguments
- Mutation examples with complete input/output structures

### version_comparison.md

Tracks schema evolution:
- **2024-10 → 2025-01:** No changes
- **2025-01 → 2025-04:** No changes
- **2025-04 → 2025-07:** No changes
- **2025-07 → unstable:** Major additions
  - New eventsink functionality (1 query, 2 mutations)
  - Enhanced transaction types with fee fields
  - New types: Eventsink, EventsinkTopic, EventsinkQueue, etc.

## Usage

These files are referenced by:
- The main documentation in `../../docs/shopify/queries.md`
- SDK development for understanding complete API surface
- Version migration planning when upgrading API versions
- Integration testing to ensure all fields are covered

## Generation

Files are automatically generated by running the Python utilities in `../utils/`:

```bash
cd ../utils
python analyze_complete_schema.py  # → complete_field_structures.txt, schema_summary.txt
python build_detailed_queries.py   # → detailed_query_examples.md
python compare_schema_versions.py  # → version_comparison.md, evolution_summary.txt
python analyze_schema.py  # -> schema_analysis.txt
```

## Integration with Documentation

The comprehensive analysis from these files was used to create the complete API documentation in `docs/shopify/queries.md`, ensuring:

- All 9 queries are fully documented with complete examples
- All 3 mutations show proper input/output structures
- Interface implementations are properly demonstrated
- Version-specific features are clearly marked
- Deprecated operations are identified and noted
